A bunch of sheet music for alto sax I've transcribed or found over the years. All sheets are in Eb (the key of the alto sax) unless otherwise noted.

#### Downloading
To download an individual file, click on it, click the "raw" button in the top right, and save it through your browser.


To download everything here, you have two options:
1) For those unafraid to use the command line, go the directory you want everything to be placed in, and run `git clone https://github.com/noloerino/sax-sheets.git`.
2) If you don't want to do that, then click the green button that says "clone or download," and select "download zip."

#### About
Most of the sheet music here was transcribed by me, but some of it was just found by random Google searches. It should be obvious which sheets I created and which ones I found online. 

There are probably a ton of formatting issues, most of them because I started out using [Noteflight](noteflight.com) before switching to [Musescore](https://musescore.org), and couldn't be bothered to re-export a bunch of stuff.

`.mscz` or `.xml` files are available by request. I take requests for new transcriptions if I know the source material and I happen to not be busy when you ask me. If you want a PDF of a song already here but in a different key, feel free to let me know and I'll post it.
